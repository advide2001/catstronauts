## About this repo

A full-stack GraphQL example application called Catstronauts, a learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
